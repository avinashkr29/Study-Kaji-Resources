## Integration with Study Kaji App

The app uses the `download_manifest.json` file to:
1. Display available packs to users
2. Show download sizes and kanji counts
3. Fetch packs from GitHub Releases
4. Extract and cache images locally

### Download Manifest
The manifest provides structured information about all available packs:
- Pack IDs and names
- Download URLs
- File sizes and content counts
- Descriptions

## Organization

Kanji within each JLPT pack are ordered by RTK lesson number (ascending), maintaining the logical learning progression from Heisig's "Remembering the Kanji" methodology.

## Usage in Apps

### Loading the Manifest
```javascript
const manifest = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avinashkr29/Study-Kaji-Resources/main/download_manifest.json');
const packs = await manifest.json();
```

### Downloading a Pack
```javascript
const packUrl = 'https://github.com/avinashkr29/Study-Kaji-Resources/releases/download/v1.0/N5.zip';
const response = await fetch(packUrl);
const zipBlob = await response.blob();
```

## Scripts

### Organization Script
The `scripts/organize_rtk.py` script handles the complete organization process:
- Parses RTK JSON data
- Groups kanji by JLPT level
- Sorts by lesson number within groups
- Copies relevant images
- Creates ZIP archives
- Generates download manifest

To regenerate packs:
```bash
cd Study-Kaji-Resources
python3 scripts/organize_rtk.py
```
